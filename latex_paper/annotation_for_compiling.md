# Annotation for compiling

Please bear in mind that under certain circumstances errors may occur with the .bbl file when compiling the .tex file. These errors are usually due to incorrect formatting. These are mainly caused by underscores that are not automatically quoted with a backslash. It may be necessary to correct the .bbl file manually.
